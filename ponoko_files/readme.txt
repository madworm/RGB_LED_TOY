This laser-cut template was used to build an acrylic 'mood light coaster' using
one of the RGB LED Ring boards.

Make sure that the line-width used for cutting is according to Ponoko's specs!

If you use Inkscape, check the values. There's not much more you can do.
The .svg file was created with Inkscape. If you have access to Adobe Illustrator,
you may want to verify the dimensions / line-widths. Ponoko seem us use Illustrator
for their final printing step.

In case of doubt, here are some vital dimensions that should be right:

Large square segments: 100x100 mm
Hexagonal holes: 5.25x5.25 mm
Battery compartments: 17x62mm
