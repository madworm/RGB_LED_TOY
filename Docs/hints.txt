* Be extremely careful with temperature when soldering the WS2812B LEDs.
  They die quite quickly if T is too high and exposure to heat is too long.
  Read the 'reflow' section of the datasheet.

* Try not to apply to much physical pressure when handsoldering. When the pads
  are heated for the solder to melt, the plastic body becomes soft. In this
  state the bonding-wires break very willingly.
